This is an StopWatch website for casual and atheletes alike.

Contains all the required features like start,stop and reset.

But wait, you got an extra feature, LEAPS!
     Leaps have been added to record in runtime so you can count a leap without stopping the timer.
     
 Times are recorded in minutes, seconds and milliseconds, so dont worry if you want to measure to the edge!

Structure:
     index.html contains the html for the website |
     mystyle.css contains the styling | 
     mechanism.js is used for scripting(adding functionality)
